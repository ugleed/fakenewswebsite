<h1>Fake News FAQ</h1>
<p style= "color:black;">“Fake news” is a popular meme that is widely used to describe and pay attention to the original and multi-layer phenomenon, which existed almost forever (at least since the warfare history), but due to the last years information society massive development, it has become the destructive power for democratic development of the world.
Democratic ground of our society is based on the assumption that each person has the right to speak and to express their point of view. And this point of view should be respected by others, because we’re all equal.
This democratic rule is being used by those, who chaise their own interest. And, in fact, no one has any right to define — is that point of view a “legitimate commentary” or “manipulation” that is being used for propaganda purposes or reaching political advantage. The biggest danger of this phenomenon is not in spreading false information, but in the polymorphism of it, when one can name another political position expression — “fake news”. Thus, due to the massive engagement of the term “fake news” to the media, its definition is blurry.
